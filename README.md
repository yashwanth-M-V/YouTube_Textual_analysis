# YouTube_Textual_analysis

This is a basic real-time project we analysis the text

I pull out the raw data from the YouTube using YouTube API 

Later I converted data into text file and then performed some textual analysis

I performed word count and word cloud for the text file

later on I used lexicon text file to find sentimental analysis

finally NCR word emotion module for emotional analysis

I have attached all the files including a word file for my process and code file to go through it.
